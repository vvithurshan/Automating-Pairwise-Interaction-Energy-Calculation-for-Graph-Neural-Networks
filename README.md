# Automating-Pairwise-Interaction-Energy-Calculation-for-Graph-Neural-Networks

The Pairwise Interaction Energy script is a powerful tool that automates the calculation of interaction energy between residues in a protein structure. The script is designed to streamline the process from the initial protein structure file generation to the final energy calculation, providing an efficient and user-friendly way to generate data for downstream analysis and visualization. <br />

The script begins by using the CHARMM36 force field to generate a protein structure file. It then sets up the complete script file to conduct molecular dynamics simulation using NAMD, a widely-used molecular dynamics software package. During the molecular dynamics simulation, the script first minimizes the structure with the backbone restrained, and then minimizes it again without backbone restraint. The temperature is then gradually increased to 300 K, and a 1 ns short molecular dynamics simulation is performed to collect the data. <br />

Finally, the script performs pairwise interaction energy calculations using the Grinn and NAMD executable, providing users with the interaction energy data that can be used to build protein graphs based on the interaction energy. The script is particularly useful in the context of graph neural network studies in biology, where protein networks based on the interaction energy are known to better explain node relationships. With this script, users can easily calculate pairwise interaction energy and generate data for downstream analysis and visualization. <br />
